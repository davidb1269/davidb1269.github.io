This week in computer science we did pair programming with assigned partners. We had somebody called the driver and somebody called the navigator.The drivers job is to guide the mouse and type on the keyboard but the navigators job is to see if the driver makes any mistakes and corrects them without using the keyboard. The navigator tells the driver to fix the problem. So we had to code a circle on pyret and when I made a mistake my partner Rajin helped spot it and correctd me. We also went over the standards for the things we have to write in our reflections.
