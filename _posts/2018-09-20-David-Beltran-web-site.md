  Hello and welcome to my blog. This year I'll be taking an AP Computer Science course to help me gain extra credits in college. I feel that this year will be a little more challenging than the computer science classes I had last year. I hope to learn much more in coding than I have last year. 
  
  I learn best around the people I am close to such as my friends. I am more productive when I work with the people I know. I do get distracted sometimes but I still always get my work done one way or the other. I also usually am the most productive when I do schoolwork that is enjoyable. 
  
  I feel that my biggest challenge this year is going to be passing the AP Computer Science Test with a high enough score for colleges to allow me to not take the class again.
