Hello and welcome to my blog. This year I'll be taking an AP Computer Science course to help me gain extra credits in college. 


Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
