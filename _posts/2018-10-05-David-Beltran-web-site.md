 This week in ap computer science we did some cool stuff. We worked a lot with animation using CSS and Pyret and played with colors that were aesthetically pleasing. We worked on color palletes to use on our websites and with HTML tags to move code in pyret and then used pyret to design a flag. We also made flags by cutting paper and pasting it onto a blank paper to recreate the flags on pyret. I chose to do the flag of Poland since it is very simple and has a very appealing color scheme. Overall it was a good week and I look forward to more fun activites like these.
