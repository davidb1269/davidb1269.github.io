This week I felt pretty good about the content we were learning. I am pretty comfortable with how the class is going and I like the things we learn. One thing I dislike about the class is how we have to go to the computers and then back when we are listening to the teacher. I feel like we should just go to tables for half the period and discuss the agenda for the period and then go to computers and then the teacher can walk around and see who needs help unless it is an independant activity.

We are learning about how to use a coordinate plane and we used a programming language called pyret to show a ball falling like it would in a flip book. We also learned how coordinate planes work. 

I am currently stuggling in focusing the whole period in class since I tend to lose focus most of the time but I still manage to get my work done. Overall I beleive that this is the main challenge I face and I enjoy computer science class.
